                        Aditya Roy, a Deputy Superintendent of Police in Delhi, was living a perfect life with his prestigious job and his beautiful fiancée, Sia, but one night, he received a phone call that messed up everything. That night, Aditya was busy writing his daily journal when he received a call from his fiancée. He thought it was a casual good night call, but it was not. She called to inform him about the sudden demise of her uncle, who had been to Bangkok for a week-long vacation. At Sia’s request, Adi flew to Bangkok as soon as possible to collect the dead body and all the information. Though the Thai Police declared it as an accident, he sensed something mysterious and due to the queer feeling; he decided to investigate the case himself. He found out that Sia’s uncle was with a hooker during the accident, and she was the only witness of that mysterious incident. He collected her details and went to meet her at the red-light street of Bangkok, the Soi Cowboy, but his heart stopped beating for a moment when he saw her. She was not a stranger to him; she was Jhiri, his old friend and the first love of his life. Though Adi was not in touch with her for nine long years, it was too hard for him to accept the fact that the girl who wanted to be a pilot once, turned herself into a hooker in Cowboy street. The old memories came flooding back and his curiosity entered the next level. Was Sia’s uncle murdered or was it just an accident? Was Jhiri involved in that murder? Why did that girl born with a silver spoon in her mouth become a hooker on Cowboy Street? Thousands of questions started running through his mind and he decided to stay back in Bangkok till he finds out all the truths.
                                Adi started his investigation and gradually, all the heart-breaking realities started coming to light. This story is about crime, friendship, love, destiny and the twists and turns of life. Life is unpredictable and no one knows what tomorrow holds.
